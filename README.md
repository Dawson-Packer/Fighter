# Fighter **(Unfinished)**
A small 2D fighting game, inspired by Capcom's 1987 classic, *Street Fighter*.

## Setup
Download the files or pull from the repo. In this directory, first run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

to install all the dependencies (only pygame in this game). To launch the game, again in this
directory, run:

    python main.py

## Usage
As of 11/26/2023, the game is playable by two players, however excessive server lag makes the user
experience a little lacking. The left player may be moved by pressing the keys **A**, **D**, and 
**SPACE**, with kicking and punching a combination of **LSHIFT**, **ARROW LEFT**, and
**ARROW RIGHT**. More moves will be added later but right now the latency is top priority.

**Stay tuned!**
