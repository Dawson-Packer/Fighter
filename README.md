# Fighter **(Unfinished)**
A small 2D fighting game, inspired by Capcom's 1987 classic, *Street Fighter*.

## Setup
Download the files or pull from the repo. In this directory, first run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

to install all the dependencies (only pygame in this game). To launch the game, again in this
directory, run:

    python main.py

## Usage
As of 11/11/2023, the game is not playable by two players. The left player may be moved by pressing
the keys **A**, **D**, and **SPACE**, with kicking and punching a combination of **LSHIFT**,
**ARROW LEFT**, and **ARROW RIGHT**. Partial functionality is implemented for both players, but
future plans mean that the right player will not be movable from keyboard input.
